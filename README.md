The system aims to design and prepare a LAN completely by itself and specify all its details.
Users who do not have any experience  networking can work on it and design  networks starting from simple questions that are understandable to users, it contributes to saving time and effort on the network engineer.
All device settings(routers configs,switches config,IPs ,ect...) are provided based on a set of rules that the user is required to enter.
